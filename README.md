# About Me

I am Mijail Gutierrez, a mathematics masters (Part III) student at Downing, University of Cambridge (2025-present). Previously I did my bachelors, also in maths at Downing (2022-2025). I am mostly interested in the areas between analytic number theory and additive combinatorics. This site is my personal website for keeping anything I may want to make public online. Currently this is only my notes and some random stuff, but may expand in the future.


# Notes

+ Michaelmas:
  - Analytic Number Theory: 
  - Algebraic Methods in combinatorics:
  - Probabilistic combinatorics:
